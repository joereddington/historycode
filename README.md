# export-history

A simple script that exports my firefox history as a webpage. 


There is a [blog post](http://joereddington.com/6530/2018/12/12/experimenting-with-public-internet-history./) that talks about the reasons behind this, and there is also a [live example](https://joereddington.github.io/export-history/)

Currently all urls are stripped down to their domain name unless they appear on 'whitelist.txt' 

## TODO 
* Put in a proper folder structure 
* Fix local files bug
* Create an actual test database
* Allow wildcards in whitelist 
* Whitelist google from certain dates
* Write up what all the scripts do here 
* Create the branch that has smartsocial and so on in.
